Introduction to Machine Learning with Time Series
=================================================

This is the repository for the "Introduction to Machine Learning with Time
Series" code breakfast at PyData Festival Amsterdam 2020.

**You can watch the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf2naBHRo8Q**

You'll learn about:

* Machine learning with time series,
* How to tell apart different learning problems (or tasks) that arise in a temporal data setting,
* How to build machine learning models to solve these tasks (using `sktime <https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime>`_ and `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`_),
* How to contribute to sktime.

We assume familiarity with the standard tabular machine learning setting
covered by `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`_, but no prior
experience of working with time series.

How to get started
------------------
You can either

* run the notebooks on Binder_ without having to install anything,
* `pip install sktime <https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/sktime/installation.html>`_ and `clone <https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository>`_ this repository to run the notebooks locally. This requires a working Python installation (e.g. `Anaconda distribution <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/>`_) with `Jupyter notebooks <https://jupyter.org/install>`_.

How to contribute
-----------------
We are actively looking for contributors! Any contributions are welcome, not
just code! Please `chat to us <https://gitter.im/sktime/community>`_ or `raise an issue <https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/new/choose>`_ if you're interested.
